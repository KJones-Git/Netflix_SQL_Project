## âœ… 15 Business Problems & SQL Solutions

Each of the following problems is solved using efficient and optimized PostgreSQL queries:

1. **Count the number of Movies vs TV Shows**  
   â†’ A simple aggregation to compare the volume of each content type.

2. **Find the most common rating for Movies and TV Shows**  
   â†’ Returns the top rating category for each type, excluding count.

3. **List all Movies released in a specific year (e.g., 2020)**  
   â†’ Useful for content strategy and trend tracking.

4. **Find the top 5 countries with the most content on Netflix**  
   â†’ Reveals Netflixâ€™s production or licensing focus.

5. **Identify the longest movie**  
   â†’ Filters and orders movies by duration.

6. **Find content added in the last 5 years**  
   â†’ Tracks recent additions to the platform using `date_added`.

7. **Find all Movies/TV Shows by director 'Rajiv Chilaka'**  
   â†’ Searches the `director` field for exact matches.

8. **List all TV Shows with more than 5 seasons**  
   â†’ Extracts and filters numeric season data from the `duration` field.

9. **Count the number of content items in each genre**  
   â†’ Explodes multi-genre fields and groups by individual genre tags.

10. **Find the top 5 years with the highest average content release in India**  
    â†’ Focuses on content produced in India, grouped by `release_year`.

11. **List all Movies that are Documentaries**  
    â†’ Filters on both `type` and genre (`listed_in` field).

12. **Find all content without a director**  
    â†’ Helps identify missing metadata.

13. **Find how many movies actor 'Salman Khan' appeared in during the last 10 years**  
    â†’ Filters based on `casts`, `release_year`, and `type`.

14. **Find the top 10 actors who have appeared in the highest number of movies produced in India**  
    â†’ Splits cast arrays and counts individual actor appearances.

15. **Categorize content as 'Good' or 'Bad' based on descriptions**  
    â†’ Flags content containing keywords like `'kill'` or `'violence'`.
